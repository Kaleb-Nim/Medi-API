       "  'answers': ['Try to create routines\\n• People with dementia often become disoriented in time. This may be the result of confusion caused by changes in the brain, memory loss or perhaps due to difficulties recognising people and objects. \\n• The “internal clock”, which enables people to know roughly when it is time to eat or sleep also tends to be disrupted. For the person with dementia, the main problem is not so much being unaware of what time it is or recognising a place and finding different rooms, but more the anxiety that this causes.\\n• The knowledge that it is midday is not particularly important, but the possibility of having missed lunch, a favourite television programme or the fear of having been deserted might well be.\\n• For example, they may seem anxious about whether it is 10 o’clock yet (the time at which the bus arrives for the day centre). In this case, it would be better to reassure them that you will make sure they do not miss the bus, rather than simply stating that it is only a quarter past nine.\\nHow to create routines\\n• You may find that the person with dementia does not really understand what you mean by “at five o’clock” or “in ten minutes”. But, there are other ways to express the passing of time. It has been found that some people with dementia can make sense of an old fashioned hourglass, even if it is not something they are used to.\\n• Try to create routines. Structure the time with meaningful routine or engagement. As it becomes increasingly difficult for the person with dementia to keep track of time, it helps if you stick to a regular routine with several events to break up the day, thereby providing some kind of structure.\\n• If there are enough events occurring throughout the day, there are more opportunities to realise roughly what time of the day it is and even what is going on.\\n• A regular routine prevents the day seeming like a continuous series of surprise events and this may reduce anxiety. One idea is to write down a plan of the day’s routine at breakfast time with the person with dementia. You could then go over it again at lunchtime. Otherwise, you could stick to more or less the same basic routine every day, without actually writing it down.']},\n",

But it can help you come to terms with loss and move forward in life, while still cherishing memories of your loved one.\\n Everyone grieves differently. Some people need to express their grief, while others prefer to process in silence.\\n Grief does not have a set time frame - It can last for weeks, months, or years. \\n It may come and go around holidays, anniversaries, and major life events, or it might always be in the background. However, grief does tend to lessen in intensity over time.\\n Not everyone experiences significant distress. People may respond to a loss with resilience or relief. \\n Relief is normal - Feeling this way does not mean that you don’t care, or that you love the person any less. It is a natural reaction after a stressful and overwhelming time in your life.\\n There are common behaviours that one experiences while grieving and it is perfectly normal to go though some or all of these in any order or any number of times:\\n• Denial: Attempting to normalise problematic behaviours instead of trying to manage them.\\n• Anger: Manifesting as frustration directed at your loved one or resenting responsibilities.\\n• Guilt: Placing unrealistic expectations on yourself and feeling you are not doing enough.\\n• Sadness: Finding yourself overwhelmed with feelings of sadness or withdrawing from social activities and withholding your emotions.  \\n• Acceptance: Coming to terms with how you have been affected and how the condition has affected your loved one and being able to ask for help.\\n Do not hesitate to see your doctor or visit a counsellor if you continue to experience five or more of these symptoms 12 months after your loved one has passed on:\\n• You feel that your grief is making you unhealthy or sick.\\n• You feel that you have been grieving for much longer than you want to.\\n• You keep thinking about harming yourself or ending your life.\\n• You are worried that you might hurt others.\\n• You are hallucinating about things that aren’t really there.\\n• Your behaviour or routine suddenly changes.\\n• You have felt hopeless and unable to cope with life for more than two weeks at a stretch.\\n• You cannot function at home, work or school.\\n• You just cannot get over a feeling of guilt.\\n• Your speech functions and body movements have become slow and tired.\\n\\n Some useful tips on how to cope\\n It’s okay to seek help. Support from family and friends can prevent grief from growing out of control. \\n Although grief will improve over time for most, this isn’t always the case. Moving on doesn’t mean forgetting. You can continue to live your life, have new experiences, and form new relationships, while continuing to love the person you lost.\\n The goal of grieving isn’t to forget, but rather to figure out how you would like to remember, while moving forward.\\n Here are some healthy ways to help you cope with grief (Dementia Hub):\\n• Get enough rest and sleep: If you cannot sleep well at night, take naps, have some quiet time, and read a book or listen to music.\\n• Carry on with your usual activities as much as possible: They will keep you occupied and engaged during this period of grief.\\n• Surround yourself with loved ones: Share memories about the deceased. Do not be afraid to laugh at funny moments that you have shared.\\n• Avoid quick fixes: It may be tempting to use alcohol, over-eating, or other unhelpful coping mechanisms as a method of dealing with grief. Although they may seem to help for a short while, they will actually make life more difficult in the long term.\\n• Try to be open to accept support from others.\\n• Take comfort in a support group or in your faith: Attending support group sessions can help you communicate with others in the same situation. Prayer and meditation can help you feel better.\\n• Get creative: Write a poem or create a painting to express your feelings. You may be able to cope with your loss in a healthier way.\\n• Rediscover or participate in activities on your own or with a group.\\n• Find time to review your finances: If you have left a paid job to provide care and feel uncertain about re-entering the workforce, here are some initiatives to assist you:\\na) Workforce Singapore helps Singaporeans in job seeking and explore new career opportunities: <a href=\" https://www.ssg-wsg.gov.sg/\" target=\"_blank\">Click for detail</a>\\nb) SkillsFuture is a national movement to provide persons with the opportunities to develop their potential through skills mastery and lifelong learning: <a href=\" https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Click for detail</a>\\nc) E2i’s Career Trial is part of the suite of career services to strengthen the employability of Singaporeans through a short-term stint with an employer: <a href=\" https://www.e2i.com.sg/businesses/manpower/career-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">Click for detail</a>']},\n",

       "  'answers': ['People with dementia often become disoriented in space. This may be the result of confusion caused by changes in the brain, memory loss or perhaps due to difficulties recognising people and objects. When people are not able to find their way around their own home, it makes them anxious.\\n• Even if the person with dementia is not disoriented in space, they may still be anxious due to the fact that there appears to be no structure to the day, or they may feel uneasy in a seemingly strange environment where anything could happen.\\n• You will probably find that the person with dementia feels more reassured if you explain that there is nothing to worry about, rather than if you simply state where they are.\\n• The person with dementia might not believe you if you insist that they are already at home, but you might be able to relieve some of the worry by explaining that they are among friends and family. Some carers have found that drawing attention to the feel of something familiar such as an armchair helps. \\nTry to maintain a stable environment\\n• It is a good idea to try to maintain a stable environment by always putting things in the same place and not making too many drastic changes.\\n• Fitting signs on doors with either a picture or words may help the person with dementia to get around their home, even when it no longer seems like a familiar place. This will not relieve them of the feeling of being lost or in the wrong place, but it will help to reduce the anxiety caused by not knowing their way round.\\n• Labels or signs on cupboards and drawers can help someone with dementia to find their way around without having to ask and draw attention to the problem.\\n• Moving the person with dementia from one place to another is likely to increase disorientation. Therefore, if other family members share the caring, it is better for them to visit, rather than move the person with dementia from one home to another in rotation.\\n• The more familiar the surroundings, the easier it is for the person with dementia to feel at home and comfortable. On the other hand, as long as the person has confidence in the family or in another person, there should not be a problem taking care of them in another place, e.g., a day care centre.']},\n",

In that way, when your loved one asks to go home, you can lead him or her into their bedroom and try talking with him or her about what they love most about their home or get him or her telling stories about their home.

       "  'answers': [\"Stages of diagnosing dementia:\\n1. Medical History:\\nDuring the medical workup, the health care provider will review the person's medical history, including psychiatric history and history of cognitive and behavioural changes. He or she will want to know about any current and past medical problems and concerns, as well as any medications the person is taking. The doctor will also ask about key medical conditions affecting other family members, including whether they may have had Alzheimer's disease or other dementias.\\n\\n2. Physical exam and diagnostic tests:\\nDuring a medical workup, the physician will likely:\\n• Ask about diet, nutrition and use of alcohol.\\n• Review all medications. (Bring a list or the containers of all medicines currently being taken, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.)\\n• Check blood pressure, temperature and pulse.\\n•  Listen to the heart and lungs.\\n• Perform other procedures to assess overall health.\\n• Collect blood or urine samples for laboratory testing.\\n\\nInformation from a physical exam and laboratory tests can help identify health issues that can cause symptoms of dementia. Common causes of dementia-like symptoms are depression, untreated sleep apnoea, delirium, side effects of medications, thyroid problems, certain vitamin deficiencies and excessive alcohol consumption. Unlike dementias, these conditions often may be reversed with treatment.\\n\\n3. Neurological exam: \\nDuring a neurological exam, the physician will closely evaluate the person for problems that may signal brain disorders other than Alzheimer's. The doctor will look for signs of stroke, Parkinson's disease, brain tumours, build-up of fluid in the brain, and other conditions that may impair memory or thinking. The physician will test:\\n• Reflexes.\\n• Coordination, muscle tone and strength.\\n• Eye movement.\\n• Speech.\\n• Sensation.       \\n\\n4. Mental cognitive status test:\\nMental cognitive status testing evaluates memory, thinking and simple problem-solving abilities. Some tests are brief, while others can be more time intensive and complex. More comprehensive mental cognitive status tests are often given by a neuropsychologist to evaluate executive function, judgment, attention and language. The MMSE and Mini-Cog test are two commonly used assessments.  \"]},\n",

Explain dental care by breaking directions into steps. \"Brush your teeth\" by itself may be too vague. Instead, walk the person through the process. Say: \"Hold your toothbrush.\" \"Put paste on the brush.\" Then, \"Brush your teeth.\"\\n• Use a \"watch me\" technique. Hold a toothbrush and show the person how to brush his or her teeth. Or, put your hand over the person\\'s hand, gently guiding the brush. If the person seems agitated or uncooperative, postpone brushing until later in the day.\\n• Keep the teeth and mouth clean. Very gently brush the person’s teeth, gums, tongue and roof of the mouth at least twice a day, with the last brushing after the evening meal and any nighttime liquid medication. Allow plenty of time and find a comfortable position if you must do the brushing yourself. Gently place the toothbrush in the person\\'s mouth at a 45 degree angle so you massage gum tissue as you clean the teeth.                                                                                                                       \\n• Try different types of toothbrushes. You may find that a soft bristled children\\'s toothbrush works better than a hard bristled adult\\'s brush. Or that a long handled or angled brush is easier to use than a standard toothbrush. Experiment until you find the best choice. Be aware that electric dental appliances may confuse your loved one a person with dementia.\\n• Floss regularly. Most dentists recommend flossing daily. If using floss is distressing to your loved one to the person with Alzheimer\\'s, try using a \"proxabrush\" to clean between teeth instead.\\n• Be aware of potential mouth pain. Investigate any signs of mouth discomfort during mealtime. Refusing to eat or strained facial expressions while eating may indicate mouth pain or dentures that don\\'t fit properly.']},\n",

Also, does your loved one have some objects he or she really loves and would be comforted by in your home? In that way, when your loved one asks to go home, you can lead him or her into their bedroom and try talking with him or her about what they love most about their home or get him or her telling stories about their home. The person may sleep poorly due to anxiety. Being surrounded by familiar things may help to lower his or her anxiety and agitation.You can gently tell your loved that they are now living with you, but remember he or she won’t be able to retain that fact. Then try to redirect her into an activity that she enjoys; something that will distract her from this thought.\\n\\n- Mind your attitude\\n• Don’t argue, “But you are home!” For one thing, the “home” being spoken of may not be the same place you’re thinking of.\\n• Hear “home” as a feeling you need to read. When people with mid- or late-stage dementia who live in a facility or are hospitalized say, “I want to go home,” what they’re really saying is, “I’m uneasy,” or “I’m scared.”\\n• Don’t be overly distressed. Hearing “I want to go home” can provoke lots of emotions in family members: Worry that “she hates it here.” Guilt at having placed her there. But remember that by mid-stage Alzheimer’s, the person is not very capable of manipulating you, if for no other reason than within a short time they will have forgotten what was said.\\n• Go along to get along.

       "  'answers': [\"- Make the environment more comfortable.\\n• Agitation and unease can be caused by many factors including physical discomfort, environmental factors and poor communication. If the person with Alzheimer's is agitated or feeling uneasy, consider what might be contributing to the change in behaviour. Is the person overstimulated by loud noises, an overactive environment or physical clutter. Large crowds or being surrounded by unfamiliar people—even within one’s own home—can be over-stimulating for a person with dementia. \\n- Modify the environment.\\n• Decrease noise and distractions or relocate. Sometimes it is too much stimulation in the environment. If that is the case, remove the person from that environment to a quieter and calmer one. \\n- Sufficient communication with patient\\n• Most people function better during a certain time of day; typically, mornings are best. Consider the time of day when making appointments or scheduling activities. Choose a time when you know the person is most alert and best able to process new information or surroundings.\\n• Is the person able to let you know that he or she is experiencing physical pain? It is not uncommon for persons with Alzheimer’s or other dementias to have urinary tract or other infections. Due to their loss of cognitive function, they are unable to articulate or identify the cause of physical discomfort and, therefore, may express it through physical/verbal aggression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        • Is the person tired because of inadequate rest or sleep?

       "  'answers': ['  + Communicating well: promotes your relationship and reduces misunderstanding, conflict and stress. Your loved one may find it challenging to make themselves understood, or understand what others are saying, because their senses dull over time. Changes in vision and hearing and slowing of reaction time may impede communication. Slurred speech and memory loss due to illness or side effects from medication may also affect their ability to speak and respond clearly.\\nAs caregivers, you can help by giving them eye contact, to show they have your attention. Listening patiently and actively by giving brief responses such as “I see” and “okay”, lets your loved one know you understand their concern. When conversing with your loved one, use simple words and short sentences, with an appropriate speed and tone of talking. Avoid using words that might be patronizing or disrespectful. You can also validate their needs by asking them to do something, instead of ordering them.  \\n  + Doing activities and exercises with them: consider their preferences and ability when suggesting activities for them to participate in. Having the ability to exercise a choice gives your loved one a sense of confidence. This will in turn increase their willingness to participate in the activities.\\nAt home, simple activities like getting dresses, having a conversation, singing, or reading, can maintain their motor and cognitive skills. Taking part in outdoor recreational activities together can also build social connections and may fulfil their emotional needs. Participating in regular physical activity may help you and your loved one to improve body balance, posture and flexibility, have better control of chronic disease symptoms, prevent falls and improve the overall well-being. Start off with some light exercises with your loved one at home like stretching.\\n  + Memories Cafe: This provides an alternative platform for social interactions and respite to caregivers and their loved ones.

Consider changing the colour of the toilet seat – a black or red seat with a white pan can make it easier to see.\\n• Try to avoid becoming constipated as this can prevent the bladder from emptying properly, which in turn can cause a UTI.

Each one of us tends to live our life according to a set of routines. They want to be respected. Some are imposed by necessity, but many reflect preferences and choices – when we go to bed, when we get up, whether we get dressed before we have breakfast or vice versa, and so on. A person with dementia may refuse to fit in with a routine that does not match their own. This is a positive sign! It shows us that your loved one with dementia still has a sense of their own identity and autonomy. Care services need to be flexible enough to fit in with the individual’s routines and maintain their dignity. \\n• Give clear explanations and repeat yourself as necessary to ease your loved one's safety concerns. \\n• Please ensure that you are going at a pace with which your loved one feels comfortable and safe and are respecting their modesty as much as possible. Refusing help is how some people communicate their need to believe that they are still independent. \\n• It is very important that we respect this and ensure that we help our loved ones to do everything that they can still do for themselves. It is often easier for a person to accept help with aspects of a task that they find difficult if they have a sense of achievement gained through completing some parts of the task on their own. \\n• Some people become more suspicious because they are losing control.

Also, does your loved one have some objects he or she really loves and would be comforted by in your home? In that way, when your loved one asks to go home, you can lead him or her into their bedroom and try talking with him or her about what they love most about their home or get him or her telling stories about their home. The person may sleep poorly due to anxiety. Being surrounded by familiar things may help to lower his or her anxiety and agitation. You can gently tell your loved that they are now living with you but remember he or she won’t be able to retain that fact. Then try to redirect her into an activity that she enjoys; something that will distract her from this thought.\\n- Mind your attitude.\\n• Don’t argue, “But you are home!” For one thing, the “home” being spoken of may not be the same place you’re thinking of.\\n• Hear “home” as a feeling you need to read. When people with mid- or late-stage dementia who live in a facility or are hospitalized say, “I want to go home,” what they’re really saying is, “I’m uneasy,” or “I’m scared.”\\n• Don’t be overly distressed. Hearing “I want to go home” can provoke lots of emotions in family members: Worry that “she hates it here.” Guilt at having placed her there. But remember that by mid-stage Alzheimer’s, the person is not very capable of manipulating you, if for no other reason than within a short time they will have forgotten what was said.\\n• Go along to get along. Underlying emotional need goes unaddressed. The person grows more distressed—and then is often medicated to calm down.']},\n",

He or she will want to know about any current and past medical problems and concerns, as well as any medications the person is taking. The doctor will also ask about key medical conditions affecting other family members, including whether they may have had Alzheimer's disease or other dementias.\\n\\n2. Physical exam and diagnostic tests:                                                                                                                                                \\nDuring a medical workup, the physician will likely:\\n• Ask about diet, nutrition and use of alcohol.\\n• Review all medications. (Bring a list or the containers of all medicines currently being taken, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.)\\n• Check blood pressure, temperature and pulse.\\n•  Listen to the heart and lungs.\\n• Perform other procedures to assess overall health.\\n• Collect blood or urine samples for laboratory testing.\\n\\nInformation from a physical exam and laboratory tests can help identify health issues that can cause symptoms of dementia. Common causes of dementia-like symptoms are depression, untreated sleep apnea, delirium, side effects of medications, thyroid problems, certain vitamin deficiencies and excessive alcohol consumption. Unlike dementias, these conditions often may be reversed with treatment.\\n\\n3. Neurological exam:                                                                                                                                                                                                      During a neurological exam, the physician will closely evaluate the person for problems that may signal brain disorders other than Alzheimer's. The doctor will look for signs of stroke, Parkinson's disease, brain tumors, buildup of fluid in the brain, and other conditions that may impair memory or thinking. The physician will test:\\n• Reflexes.\\n• Coordination, muscle tone and strength.\\n• Eye movement.\\n• Speech.\\n• Sensation.       \\n\\n4. Mental cognitive status test:                                                                                                                                                                      Mental cognitive status testing evaluates memory, thinking and simple problem-solving abilities.

A sign on the door, including both words and a picture, may help. It needs to be clearly visible, so place it within their line of sight and make sure the sign is bright, so it’s easy to see. Clear the path to the bathroom by moving furniture. You can also help your loved one to know when the toilet is vacant by leaving the toilet door open so that the toilet is visible when it’s not in use.\\n• Check the position of mirrors in the bathroom. Your loved one with dementia may confuse their reflection for someone else already in the room and not go because they think the toilet is occupied.\\n• Help your loved one to identify the toilet. You can make the bathroom standout. A contrasting colour (for example, a black seat on a white base) can make it easier to see. You can use a brighter toilet seat against a toilet bowl to help them locate it more easily or stick yellow tape around the edge of steps to help them see where they start and end – just be sure to replace the tape once it wears out\\n• Make sure your loved one has privacy in the toilet, but check that they don’t have difficulty managing locks.

To avoid your loved one from locking themselves in, disable the locks or check that you can open them quickly from the outside. \\nHelping  your loved one with dementia with mobility problems:\\n• If your loved one with dementia is less mobile, handrails and a raised toilet seat may make it easier for them to use the toilet. Some men with reduced mobility or balance or who are not able to direct their pee when standing may find it easier to sit.\\n• Make it easier for  your loved one with dementia to find their way to the toilet. Move any furniture that’s in the way, and leave open any doors that the person may find hard to open themselves. The room and the route to the toilet should be well-lit, especially at night, use nightlights to illuminate the bedroom and bathroom. \\n• If getting to the toilet becomes too difficult because of mobility problems, an aid such as a commode may be useful. This will require them to recognise the commode, know how to use it and be willing to use it.\\n• Choose clothing that will be easier for  your loved one with dementia to undo when using the toilet. Trousers with an elasticated waist are often easier than zips. Some people find ‘adaptive clothing’ with Velcro fastenings easier to use than zips or buttons. Choose clothing that is easy to clean as well \\n• Remove plants, wastebaskets and other objects that could be mistaken for a toilet. Remove throw rugs that may cause a person to trip and fall.\\n• Consider a portable commode or urinal for the bedroom in case of nighttime accidents. \\nBe supportive and reassure  your loved one with dementia to reduce feelings of embarrassment. \\n• Find ways to preserve dignity. For example say, “Anyone can have an accident” instead of saying, “You wet yourself.” \\n• Be matter-of-fact; don't scold or make them feel guilty. \\n• Respect the need for privacy as much as possible. \\n• Do not withhold fluids. This can cause dehydration, which can lead to a urinary tract infection, increased incontinence and agitated behavior. You may, however, want to limit fluids before bed. \\n• Provide positive verbal feedback for dryness and appropriate toileting. \"]},\n",

If not, kindly consult your doctor first.\\nSomeone with dementia may become dehydrated if they’re unable to communicate or recognise that they’re thirsty, or if they forget to drink. This can lead to headaches, increased confusion, urinary tract infections and constipation. These can make the symptoms of dementia worse. As people get older the sensation of thirst changes. This can mean they don’t feel thirsty even though they’re not drinking enough. Placing a drink in front of someone doesn’t always mean they will drink it. Also, an empty cup doesn’t always mean that the person has finished the drink. It may have been spilled, drunk by someone else, or poured away.\\nMake it more easily accessible:\\n• Encourage your loved one with dementia to drink throughout the day. The recommended amount is one and a half litres a day, which is around six to eight glasses per day.\\n• Have a drink on hand whenever your loved one is eating something. Use a clear glass so that your loved one can see what’s inside, or try a brightly coloured cup to draw attention instead.\\n• If possible, offer your loved one the cup or put it where they can see it clearly.\\n• Make sure the cup or glass is suitable – not too heavy or a difficult shape. Offer help to those who can't drink independently.\\nTry alternatives:\\n• Offer different types of drink throughout the day such as tea, coffee, barley, hot and cold milky drinks, fruit juice or smoothies, soup, and water. \\n• Encourage your loved one to eat foods that have a high liquid content, such as soup, juice, milk, and yoghurt.\\n• Nutritionists have created sweets called Jelly Drops®, which may help people with dementia consume more water. \"]},\n",

       "   'answers': ['Try to create routines\\n• People with dementia often become disoriented in time. This may be the result of confusion caused by changes in the brain, memory loss or perhaps due to difficulties recognising people and objects. \\n• The “internal clock”, which enables people to know roughly when it is time to eat or sleep also tends to be disrupted. For the person with dementia, the main problem is not so much being unaware of what time it is or recognising a place and finding different rooms, but more the anxiety that this causes.\\n• The knowledge that it is midday is not particularly important, but the possibility of having missed lunch, a favourite television programme or the fear of having been deserted might well be.\\n• For example, they may seem anxious about whether it is 10 o’clock yet (the time at which the bus arrives for the day centre). In this case, it would be better to reassure them that you will make sure they do not miss the bus, rather than simply stating that it is only a quarter past nine.\\nHow to create routines\\n• You may find that the person with dementia does not really understand what you mean by “at five o’clock” or “in ten minutes”. But, there are other ways to express the passing of time. It has been found that some people with dementia can make sense of an old fashioned hourglass, even if it is not something they are used to.\\n• Try to create routines. Structure the time with meaningful routine or engagement. As it becomes increasingly difficult for the person with dementia to keep track of time, it helps if you stick to a regular routine with several events to break up the day, thereby providing some kind of structure.\\n• If there are enough events occurring throughout the day, there are more opportunities to realise roughly what time of the day it is and even what is going on.\\n• A regular routine prevents the day seeming like a continuous series of surprise events and this may reduce anxiety. One idea is to write down a plan of the day’s routine at breakfast time with the person with dementia. You could then go over it again at lunchtime. Otherwise, you could stick to more or less the same basic routine every day, without actually writing it down.']}},\n",

An official diagnosis can be obtained through referral to the geriatric department of any hospital. The costs of diagnosis would include visits to a specialist as well as the costs of running diagnostic tests. These tests can include brain scans, a psychiatric evaluation, laboratory tests of blood or spinal fluid, and a neurological evaluation. Nevertheless, early diagnosis has been shown to be able to cut the costs of dementia care by nearly 30 per cent as it can reduce spending on unnecessary tests and treatments.\\nSome potential costs for various tests:\\n1. Cost of brain scan: $375\\n2. Cost of psychiatric evaluation: $124-$188 per hour\\n3. Cost of neurological evaluation: $180-$200 per session\\n4. Cost of laboratory tests: $400 for positron emission tomography (PET)']}},\n",

']}, {'questions': ['Does your loved one with dementia often confuse daytime and night time?', 'Unable to have a sense of time', 'Confusing day and night'], 'answers': ['Try to create routines\\n• People with dementia often become disoriented in time. This may be the result of confusion caused by changes in the brain, memory loss or perhaps due to difficulties recognising people and objects. \\n• The “internal clock”, which enables people to know roughly when it is time to eat or sleep also tends to be disrupted. For the person with dementia, the main problem is not so much being unaware of what time it is or recognising a place and finding different rooms, but more the anxiety that this causes.\\n• The knowledge that it is midday is not particularly important, but the possibility of having missed lunch, a favourite television programme or the fear of having been deserted might well be.\\n• For example, they may seem anxious about whether it is 10 o’clock yet (the time at which the bus arrives for the day centre). In this case, it would be better to reassure them that you will make sure they do not miss the bus, rather than simply stating that it is only a quarter past nine.\\nHow to create routines\\n• You may find that the person with dementia does not really understand what you mean by “at five o’clock” or “in ten minutes”. But, there are other ways to express the passing of time. It has been found that some people with dementia can make sense of an old fashioned hourglass, even if it is not something they are used to.\\n• Try to create routines. Structure the time with meaningful routine or engagement. As it becomes increasingly difficult for the person with dementia to keep track of time, it helps if you stick to a regular routine with several events to break up the day, thereby providing some kind of structure.\\n• If there are enough events occurring throughout the day, there are more opportunities to realise roughly what time of the day it is and even what is going on.\\n• A regular routine prevents the day seeming like a continuous series of surprise events and this may reduce anxiety.

Grieving often involves sadness, anger, loneliness, and other painful emotions. But it can help you come to terms with loss and move forward in life, while still cherishing memories of your loved one.\\n Everyone grieves differently. Some people need to express their grief, while others prefer to process in silence.\\n Grief does not have a set time frame - It can last for weeks, months, or years. \\n It may come and go around holidays, anniversaries, and major life events, or it might always be in the background. However, grief does tend to lessen in intensity over time.\\n Not everyone experiences significant distress. People may respond to a loss with resilience or relief. \\n Relief is normal - Feeling this way does not mean that you don’t care, or that you love the person any less. It is a natural reaction after a stressful and overwhelming time in your life.\\n There are common behaviours that one experiences while grieving and it is perfectly normal to go though some or all of these in any order or any number of times:\\n• Denial: Attempting to normalise problematic behaviours instead of trying to manage them.\\n• Anger: Manifesting as frustration directed at your loved one or resenting responsibilities.\\n• Guilt: Placing unrealistic expectations on yourself and feeling you are not doing enough.\\n• Sadness: Finding yourself overwhelmed with feelings of sadness or withdrawing from social activities and withholding your emotions.  \\n• Acceptance: Coming to terms with how you have been affected and how the condition has affected your loved one and being able to ask for help.\\n Do not hesitate to see your doctor or visit a counsellor if you continue to experience five or more of these symptoms 12 months after your loved one has passed on:\\n• You feel that your grief is making you unhealthy or sick.\\n• You feel that you have been grieving for much longer than you want to.\\n• You keep thinking about harming yourself or ending your life.\\n• You are worried that you might hurt others.\\n• You are hallucinating about things that aren’t really there.\\n• Your behaviour or routine suddenly changes.\\n• You have felt hopeless and unable to cope with life for more than two weeks at a stretch.\\n• You cannot function at home, work or school.\\n• You just cannot get over a feeling of guilt.\\n• Your speech functions and body movements have become slow and tired.\\n\\n Some useful tips on how to cope\\n It’s okay to seek help. Support from family and friends can prevent grief from growing out of control. \\n Although grief will improve over time for most, this isn’t always the case. Moving on doesn’t mean forgetting. You can continue to live your life, have new experiences, and form new relationships, while continuing to love the person you lost.\\n The goal of grieving isn’t to forget, but rather to figure out how you would like to remember, while moving forward.\\n Here are some healthy ways to help you cope with grief (Dementia Hub):\\n• Get enough rest and sleep: If you cannot sleep well at night, take naps, have some quiet time, and read a book or listen to music.\\n• Carry on with your usual activities as much as possible: They will keep you occupied and engaged during this period of grief.\\n• Surround yourself with loved ones: Share memories about the deceased. Do not be afraid to laugh at funny moments that you have shared.\\n• Avoid quick fixes: It may be tempting to use alcohol, over-eating, or other unhelpful coping mechanisms as a method of dealing with grief.

Medical History:\\nDuring the medical workup, the health care provider will review the person's medical history, including psychiatric history and history of cognitive and behavioural changes.

The doctor will also ask about key medical conditions affecting other family members, including whether they may have had Alzheimer's disease or other dementias.\\n\\n2. Physical exam and diagnostic tests:\\nDuring a medical workup, the physician will likely:\\n• Ask about diet, nutrition and use of alcohol.\\n• Review all medications. (Bring a list or the containers of all medicines currently being taken, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.)\\n• Check blood pressure, temperature and pulse.\\n•  Listen to the heart and lungs.\\n• Perform other procedures to assess overall health.\\n• Collect blood or urine samples for laboratory testing.\\n\\nInformation from a physical exam and laboratory tests can help identify health issues that can cause symptoms of dementia. Common causes of dementia-like symptoms are depression, untreated sleep apnoea, delirium, side effects of medications, thyroid problems, certain vitamin deficiencies and excessive alcohol consumption. Unlike dementias, these conditions often may be reversed with treatment.\\n\\n3. Neurological exam: \\nDuring a neurological exam, the physician will closely evaluate the person for problems that may signal brain disorders other than Alzheimer's. The doctor will look for signs of stroke, Parkinson's disease, brain tumours, build-up of fluid in the brain, and other conditions that may impair memory or thinking.

Encourage the person with dementia to drink by finding out their preferences and making drinks readily available and visible. Using a brightly coloured glass or cup can help with this.\\n• Monitor fluid intake for people who are less mobile and at risk of dehydration. If someone is not drinking enough and/or has difficulty with swallowing, consider asking for an assessment by a speech and language therapist. Dehydration may cause the person to pass darker, more concentrated urine which may also cause pain on urination.\\n• Do not hold urine in the bladder for too long. People with dementia should be prompted to use the toilet on a regular basis. Make sure the location of the toilet is clear. A sign on the door, with a picture, may help. Consider changing the colour of the toilet seat – a black or red seat with a white pan can make it easier to see.\\n• Try to avoid becoming constipated as this can prevent the bladder from emptying properly, which in turn can cause a UTI. Eating foods high in fibre, drinking plenty of liquids and exercising can help to prevent constipation.\\n• Maintain good hygiene – wash the genitals at least once a day using unperfumed soap and do not use talcum powder.\\n• Women should wipe ‘front to back’ after using the toilet. The availability of easily accessible wet wipes in the bathroom may help to promote good hygiene.\\n• When a urinary catheter is being used, follow good infection prevention measures – your healthcare professional will be able to advise.']}, {'questions': ['Do you require help with legal issues?', 'Do you require any legal aid?', 'Do you require any legal assistance?', 'Are you currently seeking legal counsel?

If not, kindly consult your doctor first.\\nWhat are the reasons for reduced eating? \\nA person living with dementia may start losing interest in food and consequently lose weight from reduced food intake. This tends to happen towards the advanced stage of dementia. While it may seem as though the person is being starved, the reality is that their metabolic rate goes down and they use up less energy too. The person living with dementia may not be as active or mobile as before and may not require the same number of calories they had when they were more active. Moreover, having a reduced interest in food or fluid intake can be a part of dementia progression.\\nHow to manage reduced eating? \\n• Look for opportunities to encourage the person living with dementia to eat. If they are mostly at night, light night-time snacks may be a good idea.\\n• Encourage them to get involved in preparation during mealtimes where possible\\n• Encourage them to enjoy a snack\\n• Offer familiar or favourite food and drinks\\n• Choose the most flavourful food for mealtimes\\n• Offer small amounts of food and drinks throughout the day                                                        \\n• Never force feed or make them eat when drowsy \\n• Make sure your loved one with dementia is fully awake, comfortable and sitting upright before you offer food and drink.\\n• Avoid foods that your loved one with dementia has difficulty chewing.\\nConsider learning how to prevent dysphagia (swallowing problems), Discuss with your doctor on options for artifical feeding.']}, {'questions': ['Does your loved one with dementia have frequent toilet accidents', 'dementia toilet accidents', 'dementia unable to identify toilet', 'frequent toilet accidents'], 'answers': [\"Has this been evaluated by a doctor? If not, kindly consult your doctor first.\\nYou may contact a telemedicine provider through the CareBuddy app. \\nHelping your loved one with confusion:\\n• Help your loved one with dementia to identify where the toilet is. A sign on the door, including both words and a picture, may help. It needs to be clearly visible, so place it within their line of sight and make sure the sign is bright, so it’s easy to see. Clear the path to the bathroom by moving furniture. You can also help your loved one to know when the toilet is vacant by leaving the toilet door open so that the toilet is visible when it’s not in use.\\n• Check the position of mirrors in the bathroom. Your loved one with dementia may confuse their reflection for someone else already in the room and not go because they think the toilet is occupied.\\n• Help your loved one to identify the toilet. You can make the bathroom standout. A contrasting colour (for example, a black seat on a white base) can make it easier to see. You can use a brighter toilet seat against a toilet bowl to help them locate it more easily or stick yellow tape around the edge of steps to help them see where they start and end – just be sure to replace the tape once it wears out\\n• Make sure your loved one has privacy in the toilet, but check that they don’t have difficulty managing locks. Some people with dementia struggle with this. To avoid your loved one from locking themselves in, disable the locks or check that you can open them quickly from the outside. \\nHelping  your loved one with dementia with mobility problems:\\n• If your loved one with dementia is less mobile, handrails and a raised toilet seat may make it easier for them to use the toilet. Some men with reduced mobility or balance or who are not able to direct their pee when standing may find it easier to sit.\\n• Make it easier for  your loved one with dementia to find their way to the toilet. Move any furniture that’s in the way, and leave open any doors that the person may find hard to open themselves. The room and the route to the toilet should be well-lit, especially at night, use nightlights to illuminate the bedroom and bathroom. \\n• If getting to the toilet becomes too difficult because of mobility problems, an aid such as a commode may be useful. This will require them to recognise the commode, know how to use it and be willing to use it.\\n• Choose clothing that will be easier for  your loved one with dementia to undo when using the toilet. Trousers with an elasticated waist are often easier than zips. Some people find ‘adaptive clothing’ with Velcro fastenings easier to use than zips or buttons. Choose clothing that is easy to clean as well \\n• Remove plants, wastebaskets and other objects that could be mistaken for a toilet. Remove throw rugs that may cause a person to trip and fall.\\n• Consider a portable commode or urinal for the bedroom in case of nighttime accidents. \\nBe supportive and reassure  your loved one with dementia to reduce feelings of embarrassment. \\n• Find ways to preserve dignity. For example say, “Anyone can have an accident” instead of saying, “You wet yourself.” \\n• Be matter-of-fact; don't scold or make them feel guilty. \\n• Respect the need for privacy as much as possible. \\n• Do not withhold fluids. This can cause dehydration, which can lead to a urinary tract infection, increased incontinence and agitated behavior. You may, however, want to limit fluids before bed. \\n• Provide positive verbal feedback for dryness and appropriate toileting. \"]}, {'questions': ['Does your loved one with dementia have problems with hearing?', 'Does your loved one with dementia struggle to follow a conversation?', 'Having hearing problems', 'Unable to follow conversations'], 'answers': [\"Has this been evaluated by a doctor?
